This is the sweet spot. We combine the **"Executive Assistant"** metaphor (the emotional hook) with the **Granola/Howie aesthetic** (the visual credibility).

The positioning shifts from "Productivity Tool" to **"The World's First AI Chief of Staff for Individual Contributors."**

### **The Design Concept: "White Glove Service"**

- **The Vibe:** Calm, capable, invisible. It doesn't nag you; it supports you.
- **The Visuals:** Creamy backgrounds, sharp serif headers, and UI elements that look like clean paper stationery or high-end agendas.
- **The Metaphor:** You are the Talent. Mitable is the Handler.

### **Why this "Secretary" Angle Works Best:**

1.  **It flatters the user:** Instead of saying "You are disorganized, use this tool," it says "You are important, you deserve an assistant."
2.  **It explains the "Doc Generation":** Why would a screen recorder write docs? It wouldn't. But an _Assistant_ watching you work absolutely would write up the process for you.
3.  **It justifies the "To-Dos":** A good assistant nudges you about the things you dropped.
4.  **It sounds human:** Phrases like "I drafted this for you," or "I noticed you left this open" feel warm and helpful (Granola style) rather than robotic (Standard SaaS style).

### **Visual Details to "Nail It":**

- **The "Paper" Aesthetic:** The wireframe implies that the "Summary" isn't just text in a box, but looks like a typed memo on a desk.
- **The "Cursor":** In animations, use a cursor that acts like the "Assistant." It highlights text, clicks buttons, and "types" the summaries.
- **Color Palette:** Stick to the warm alabaster, but use **Deep Navy Blue** (`#0F172A`) for the "Pro/Executive" elements instead of black. It feels more corporate-chic.
